# Internal Legacy Scripts

This folder contains legacy scripts and diagnostic tools used during previous development phases or migrations.

> [!WARNING]
> These scripts are NOT intended for use in CI/CD or production environments. They often rely on hardcoded local configurations (.env.local) and direct database access.

## Usage
Only use these scripts for manual debugging or one-off administrative tasks in development environments.
Always verify the script content before execution.
