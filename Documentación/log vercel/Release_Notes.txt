vfx app release notes
---------------------

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101130
--------------------------------------

* Fixed bug where if a channel was soloed, then other non-soloed 
  channels at 0dB gain would still be heard.

* Try and set entire plugin folder writeable when assimilating
  a plugin. This fixes problems with plugins that need to write
  to their folder.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101122
--------------------------------------

* Better app restart mechanism on Mac that lets the launcher script 
  exec into the vfx wine app.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101118
--------------------------------------

* Get plugin parameter units more reliably.

* Much nicer handling of bank and program change, so things are likely to
  happen more like what you would expect.

* Globally-learned "accept" and "back" buttons work in the
  bank/preset confirmation screens.

* If there is a single preset in a bank, then MIDI program change will
  change the patch of the first plugin in that preset if program
  changes would normally be routed to the mixer.

* Hitting the V-MACHINE "Panic" function causes the active parameter 
  to revert to the patch for the active plugin.

* Channel mute works correctly.

* Only unload plugin DLL's when really necessary - i.e. when deleting them,
  changing to a new library, etc.

* VFX application restarts when a plugin DLL is unloaded.

* MIDI PANIC sends all notes off correctly again!

* MIDI PANIC goes out on channel 16 (previously channel 16 was missed!).

* MIDI PANIC works across splits now.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101026
--------------------------------------

* Strip any trailing newline at the end of parameter value
  display strings (fixes strange/missing units for VSM).

* Tightened up protection against strange use of string buffers
  by plugin DLL's when getting parameter information from VST plugins.

* Fixed v-machine logo colours in PC/Mac app that were a bit too
  light in the previous build.

* Latest wizards.

* Updated user guide and quick start.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101015
--------------------------------------

* Only change selected parameter on plugin-initiated parameter change
  (e.g. by twiddling gui knob) if the change occurs both:
    - more than a short time after the plugin's gui was opened AND
    - more than a short time after the last plugin-initiated parameter 
      change.

  This prevents plugins that do a big parameter splatter at certain 
  times (e.g. initialisation, setting chunk, opening gui, etc) from 
  changing the selected parameter when that change is not wanted.

* Twiddling a gui knob or selecting a parmater table parameter will
  change the parameter about to be learned in midi learn mode.

* Don't attempt to display units for plugins that nastily put -1 in
  the unit string buffer (fixes parameter value display corruption
  for Lounge Lizard).

* Implemented transpose in the VFX application GUI.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101013
--------------------------------------

* VFX application contains latest wizard database.

* "Import Plugin" comes before library import/export commands in the
  "File" menu.

* Added new wizard parameter "no_set_program_before_chunk".
  All plugins have their program set before their chunk unless this
  wizard parameter has a non-zero value.

* Avoid receiving parameter notifications from plugins while loading
  and setting chunks on plugins.

* Fixed a nasty bug where using the front panel to change a two-state
  parameter would crash the VFX application.

* Avoid the strange blue text in the front panel that occurred after
  renaming a preset (on Windows only).

* Fixed active selection handling in front panel controller so
  that scrolling with priority parameters ticked works again.

* Scroll to selected table row when the selection changes and the
  newly selected row is not in view.

* Fixed broken plugin import. All plugins should import fine now.

* Reverted change where all plugins never unload their DLL. This
  was a bit over the top, and also very inconvenient when deleting
  plugins from a VFX library (because the vfx app had to quit).

* Twiddling plugin parameters via their VST GUIs changes the selected
  parameter in the front panel and in the parameter table.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20101012
--------------------------------------

* Active plugin is highlighted blue in it's slot.

* When changing the front panel parameter, the parameter table
  highlight changes to show which parameter is active.

* When clicking in the parameter table, update the front panel to 
  show the parameter that was clicked on.

* When selecting a plugin by clicking on it, show it's "patch"
  parameter in the front panel.

* When choosing a new plugin for a slot, make that slot the
  active slot if a new plugin was chosen.

* Don't allow making a slot active that has no plugin in it.

* Show the message "No plugin" in the front panel when there is
  a slot active that has no plugin in it.

* Time signature denominator can only be one of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

* BPM defaults to 120.

* The Windows partition of the Classic Keys DVD will not be auto-mounted.
  This prevents people from running the classic keys installer from that
  partition, and consequently running into trouble when they try to
  access the large VSM resources file that the Mac cannot access
  (at least not in OSX 10.4 and 10.5).

* The Mac mount of the Classic Keys DVD is shown as the initial folder when
  running a VST plugin installer on Mac.

* Fixed assertion failure in vfx library dialog on Mac that was going off
  when collapsing a tree node, and causing no item to be selected.

* The active preset is automatically saved under the following circumstances:
   - Before any sync or export operation.
   - After it is renamed.

* For generally increased stability, never unload DLL's when running on PC/Mac.
  A lot of plugins cause trouble when their DLL is unloaded, and even more trouble
  if it is subsequently loaded again. (Note: plugin instances are still created
  and freed as per normal).

* There is a notification mechanism on meta data about a plugin, so that
  the host can be updated when a plugin becomes licensed or unlicensed.
  This results in the correct presence or absence of an unlicensed warning
  on the front panel.

* If a plugin must be licensed in order to run on a vmachine, and it is not
  licensed, and it is put on a vmachine, then the message "No license" is
  displayed instead of "Bad license" as it was before.

* Accept any of the following wizard variables to indicate that a plugin must be
  licensed in order to run on a v-machine: license_required, licence_required,
  must_be_licensed_on_vmachine.

* Various changes to prevent Key Performer crashes when it loads
  new chunks:

    - Don't set program before setting chunk.
    - Only use "effStopProcess" and "effStartProcess" when stopping and
      starting plugins. Set "effMainsChanged" to off only
      when about to free a plugin instance.
    - Added wizard variable "no_vst_chunks" to use only parameter dumps
      with a plugin, and not chunk files, even if the plugin thinks
      it can use chunk files.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100812
--------------------------------------

* Added ezdrummer auth tool to toolset.

* Fixed bug where on V-MACHINE, the parameter values on
  the first loaded preset could not be changed.

* Removed dodgy reset "feature" that was resetting when 
  it shouldn't.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100811
--------------------------------------

* Installers get quickstart guide.

* Latest wizard database built in to vfx application.

* Added wizard parameter "licence_required" to prevent plugins
  from instantiating on a v-machine unless they are licensed. Useful
  for plugins like Lounge Lizard that throw up a GUI and hang the V-MACHINE
  if they are not licensed.

* Max. menu items upped from 1000 to 5000 on Windows - so you can have more
  banks.

* Better handling of selected objects reset (i.e. selected channel and plugin) 
  when the active preset is changed, that prevents doubling up on certain gui
  initialisation activities including opening the plugin gui window twice.
  This change solves the problem where certain plugins show something special
  in their gui the first time it is opened after they are loaded 
  (e.g. license info prompts).

* VFX application restart function on V-MACHINE uses printf correctly, and does
  not have a delayed message if there is a popup message at the time of reset.

* Added a low-powered reset function - hold "panic", then press "menu".
  Low-powered because it doesn't work if the main event loop is not running
  (which occurs if a plugin throws up a message box for example).

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100611
--------------------------------------

* Nicer and more consistent firmware update messages.

* V-MACHINE popups show for 2 seconds.

* Tuned device certificate installation prompts. There is now only
  one simple prompt. The internet check happens automatically.

* New wizard builtins:

    $VFX_BUILTIN(common_documents)
    The path to the windows common documents folder.
    C:/Documents and Settings/AllUsers/Documents

    $VFX_BUILTIN(win_common_documents)
    The path to the windows common documents folder.
    C:\Documents and Settings\AllUsers\Documents

* Show an ellipsis on busy messages for a tiny bit before spinning.
  This prevents annoying "spin too soon" and ugly "stuck spinner"
  (which occurs in the latter case when the h8 is busy).

* Plugin licensing changes:
   - Plugins that are licensed with the "License Plugin" feature will only run 
     on the V-MACHINE that they are licensed for. If run on a different V-MACHINE,
     the plugin will not load, and the V-MACHINE front panel displays which
     plugin has the problem.
   - The license information (serial numbers, registration keys, etc) is
     obfuscated to be non-human readable in the plugin info file.
   - Only the V-MACHINE that license information was generated for can
     read that license information from the plugin info file.

* Show front panel warning for unlicensed plugins, or for plugins
  with a bad license.

* The "load plugin" errors that can occur on the V-MACHINE now report the
  plugin that has the problem on the front panel display.

* Resolved front panel busy/popup message conflict. Now front panel popup
  messages on the V-MACHINE display for the correct amount of time even
  when there is a simultaneous busy message. The popup message takes
  precedence over the busy message.

* Syncrosoft support removed.

* Fixes to V-MACHINE midi handling to prevent hung notes and inter-device
  MIDI interleaving when USB midi devices are used to play music.

* The V-MACHINE's windows drive has a unique serial number. This
  allows plugin DRM tools to uniquely identify individual V-MACHINEs.

* On Mac, import from a vfxlibrary when it is double clicked and the
  VFX application is not yet running.

* On Mac, the vfx application identifies itself as "VFX" instead of
  "vfx_application". The full new identifier is "com.smproaudio.VFX".
  Application prefs and data have moved to
      .../Preferences/com.smproaudio.VFX.plist
  and .../Preferences/com.smproaudio.VFX.data
  respectively.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100505
--------------------------------------

* Send levels from older non-quadratic-fader-curve presets are converted
  correctly when those older-style presets are loaded.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100504
--------------------------------------

* Fixed MIDI routing bug where in the following configuration...

   - plugin with no midi-out in slot A, and midi-thru turned on.
   - plugin in slot B accepting midi from "computer" and from slot A.

  ...the plugin in slot B was not playing any notes.

* Look for device certificates at the correct URL when checking online.

* Fixed bug where a channel fader stopped working when the master fader
  was at unity gain and vice versa.

* Save/import/export is confined to the "File" menu. There are no longer
  duplicate file operations in the bank and preset menus (context or
  otherwise).

* Send midi panic on all MIDI channels (i.e. not just channel 0 which 
  is what was happening until this point).

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100427
--------------------------------------

* V-MACHINE certificates are now packaged up inside the VFX executable. The VFX
  application will try and install a certificate when a V-MACHINE is connected.
  If a valid certificate is not found for the connected V-MACHINE, then the old
  file or internet choice is given. This happens every time the V-MACHINE
  application connects. The user is prompted to contact VFX for support if no
  valid certificate can be found.

* Fixed bug where the original shipped VFX library would not run SampleTank 2
  off external storage because of it's old Z: drive-ridddled instrument cache
  being invalid.

* Missing folder during plugin import prompts user for a "folder" instead of
  the more cryptic "dir".

* Fixed USB stick bug where sticks with a FAT32 filesystem mounted directly on the
  block device were not being set read-write. This meant that until now any USB
  stick that was formatted in this way would have random plugin failures (for
  any plugin that needed to write to the stick such as SampleTank2 SE that
  ships with the V-MACHINE) and exporting to those sticks would not work.

* When changing banks, browse to the first preset of the new bank rather than
  the preset with the same index as to old preset (this is how it used to be 
  a month or so ago).

* Fixed bug on V-MACHINE where forwarding MIDI from a USB MIDI keyboard along
  to a connected PC was occasionally missing notes.

* MIDI CC in parameter table displays as "None" when 0 (which means none)
  is entered.

* Parameter table in PC application updates the MIDI CC column when a
  parameter is unlearned. If an old parameter was assigned to a CC when
  that CC is learned to a different parameter, then the old parameter
  will update in the table view also.

* Some "may not work" info is displayed after importing a plugin without
  using a Wizard file.

* Show Channel and Slot in plugin GUI title bar (previously only slot was shown).

* There is no more "VFX Plugin Auth" menu item. Plugin auth is to be handled
  by one or more of:
      - the wizard (when you click "License Plugin for V-MACHINE")
      - the plugin GUI itself
      - dragging an auth file into the plugin folder in Windows Explorer
        or Mac Finder.

* Firmware update procedure improvements:
    - There is no more "Format V-MACHINE" menu item. Firmware update and
      format are handled by a single menu item now.
    - The VFX application does not crash if a V-MACHINE is unplugged while
      the update prompt is being displayed.
    - A V-MACHINE in update mode can be reconnected over and over again to
      the VFX application

* V-MACHINE logging goes to connected VFX application log file when V-MACHINE logging
  is turned on.

* Fixed bug where "connect vmachine to license" prompt was not detecting the connection
  or removal of a vmachine.

* Correctly load older vfx chunk files that had bad CRC's as produced
  by VFX build 20091208.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100420
--------------------------------------

* Import, export, and sync with plugins by default.

* When importing and exporting banks, check for duplicate names and only
  warn about replacing banks if there are actually banks to replace. The
  names for replaced banks are displayed in the warning.

* Don't confirm bank selection on MIDI bank change. The selection will
  only be confirmed when a MIDI program change arrives.

* Fixed low level MIDI handler that was incorrectly blending MIDI from
  different MIDI-IN devices into a single buffer. There is now a separate MIDI
  buffer for each MIDI-IN device.

* Massive fix and simplification of V-MACHINE COMMS layer:
    - No more reentrancy in V-MACHINE comms routines.
    - Bugs associated with re-entrancy are now gone. These were especially
      apparent on Windows 7 and prevented firmware update and basic
      V-MACHINE comms from occuring on some machines.

* When importing a plugin with a wizard, warn if there is:

      - a parameter count mismatch 
   OR - a version mismatch (but only when the wizard file has a version field)

  between the plugin and the wizard, and allow the user to proceed with the
  real values from the plugin if they really want to. The import dialog now
  displays the parameter count for the plugin and the wizard also.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100416
--------------------------------------

* Plugins that appear to be SynthEdit plugins will never have their DLL's
  unloaded when running on Mac/wine. Unloading OP-X or Stringer (both
  SynthEdit plugs) on Mac/wine makes them become unstable for future
  loads. Plugin wizards can have a "dont_free_library_on_mac" variable that
  will force a DLL to never unload on Mac. This wizard variable overrides
  the automatic synthedit detection on Mac.

--------------------------------------
v2.0 20100415
--------------------------------------

* Windows VFX just has the one "Show VST Editor" option now. The parameter
  table is always shown (just like on Mac).

* Load chunk files prior to instantiating plugins. This helps plugins
  work on wine (and especially on Mac) that have some kind of race condition
  inside wine during instantiation (e.g. Stringer and certain other
  SynthEdit plugins).

* On Mac, Wine output now goes in vfx.log in the user's Logs directory.
  There is no more vfx.exe.so.log alongside the vfx application launcher
  script that used to contain this output.

* Fixed a thread priority changing bug on Mac where priority was being set
  to the V-MACHINE's idea of "high" priority, which is nastily high for
  a general purpose computer. Now the Mac's idea of "high" is just the
  priority that the main app thread starts up with.

* The V-MACHINE and Mac builds set main thread priority to quite low
  while loading a DLL, unloading a DLL, and setting chunks on plugins.
  This seems to bizarrely make certain plugins not crash during these
  operations.

* Fixed bug where the parameter table did not refresh when the 
  selected plugin remained the same when changing presets.

* Fixed bug where the parameter table was not being hooked up to parameter
  changes on plugins inserted into slots after a preset was loaded.

* Correctly step parameter values according to parameter info from
  plugins.

* A much nicer sliding parameter algorithm for stepping parameter
  values when no step info is available (no longer misses steps).

* Path-handling refactor - result is more reliable path handling and 
  finally Windows network-style paths work on Windows ("\\foo\bar").

* Added front panel and app menu item "Delete all presets in bank".

* Upped major.minor version to "2.0".

* Preset files now have a version number for the preset file format.

* Presets made prior to quadratic fader curves have their faders and
  pans converted to the new level system so that they still sound the same.

* MIDI program change delay defaults to "Immediate".

* Retain old selected preset index if possible when changing
  banks.

--------------------------------------
v1.5 20100408
--------------------------------------

* The import-plugin wizard now refuses to copy any file into a vfx plugin
  folder that reports it's product name as "Wine". This is useful for
  preventing Mac-wine DLL's from polluting the V-MACHINE-wine environment.

* Don't load VFX plugin chunks that have newer formats than are supported
  by the current vfx app build.

* Fixed bug where program changes were sometimes being lost if preceeded
  by a bank select.

* Fixed introduced bug where MIDI CC 0 was being processed as a learned
  parameter.

* Use bank select MSB if a controller cares to send it:
      - Use MSB as bank LSB if the controller does not send bank LSB.
      - Use MSB as bank MSB if the controller sends bank LSB.

* Don't crash when using bad file characters in preset and bank names.

* Fixed bad bounds check when setting plugin program when a preset is first
  loaded.

* Fixed recent introduced bug where the front panel could not be used to change
  the plugin patch.

* Revamped the wine build system on Mac:
    - Use latest wine version (1.1.41) for better Windows installer support.
    - Use macports to build wine, thus getting all the Mac-friendliness that
      macports provides including X client library patches, and most
      of wine's optional dependencies are now turned on.
    - This resolves Lounge Lizard installer and DLL problems on Mac.

* Allow any extended ascii character (0x80-0xff) in filenames.

--------------------------------------
v1.5 20100330
--------------------------------------

* Mac - Added wine-gecko to wine folder for html rendering support of plugins
  and their installers.

* Mac - Import-plugin dialog refreshes correctly after the
  "update wizard database" button is clicked.

* Mac/PC - Info prompts cannot have their text field written into, but
  can still be selected and copied from.

* Mac - Info/input prompts get more space for their message.

* Wizard files - $VFX_REG_STRING will expand integer and binary keys into
  string form. Binary values come out looking like "0a,fe,d2,2d" (i.e.
  suitable for quoting in the "registry_keys" value of a wizard file).

* Mac - Show popup to allow user to keep Windows partition mounted for as
  long as a Windows installation from that partition requires.

* Mac - Forcibly unmount (umount -f) Windows partition when the time to
  unmount arrives.

* Set plugin program and chunk sequentially inside the same 
  effBeginSetProgram/effEndSetProgram nest.

* Refuse to instantiate plugin if parameter count in plugin info (e.g.
  from wizard file) does not match actual parameter count of plugin.
  A message pops up on the front panel display "Bad param count".

* Tweaked vmachine initialisation sequence so that the host is started when
  plugins are initially configured in the host. This makes plugins like VB3
  configure correctly at startup (it needs to be running to acknowledge
  program and parameter changes). This also makes the true-pianos custom
  loading GUI display correctly if it is the very first plugin that is 
  loaded when a V-MACHINE is turned on.

--------------------------------------
v1.5 20100326
--------------------------------------

* Always attempt to create Windows special folders when retrieving their location.
  This is especially important when running on Wine - stops a lot of assertion
  failures that were occuring when official Windows locations did not exist.
  Also makes things work properly on machines where Windows has been upgraded
  from XP to Vista or Win7 and the machine has lots of special folders that
  don't exist under the naming scheme of the newer version of Windows.

* Mac - Clicking the "Run VST Plugin Installer" menu item results in the VFX
        app having a go at mounting the Windows-software partition of any
        inserted hybrid optical disk. The contents of the disk are shown if
        such partition was mounted. If not, then the contents of any currently
        mounted ISO partition on an optical disk are shown.
        Any partition that was mounted at this point is unmounted again once
        the plugin installer has been executed.

* Mac - Distribute free clones of Windows core fonts into wine fonts folder.
        Corollory: Virtual String Machine GUI works on Mac now.

* Changed order of plugin instance destruction/creation when changing presets.
  Any unused plugin instances in the new preset are first destroyed before
  any new instances are instantiated.
  Corollary: Sampletank will not crash under wine when navigating from a preset
             with some other IK-brand plugin (e.g. Amplitube) to a preset with
             Sampletank.

* Mac - corrected Mac transfer speed constant to accurately reflect USB
        transfer time on Mac.

* Mac - Fixed #2316 - mac app plugin import drop down list is small.

* Mac - Allow browsing inside mac file packages when the file being opened is not itself
  a mac file package (especially useful for browsing inside wine folder for
  Windoze-y stuff).

* Mac - Fixed #2320 - When a file to copy does not exist, the window to locate the
    file does not appear and the vfx app appears to have hung.

* Mac - Fixed #2319 - import plugin dialog - After updating wizard database, it is
    now impossible to import anything - ok button greyed out, wizard selection not
    updating for selected plugin. Also after "browse"ing, and cancelling, can't
    select from dropdown.

* Fixed generation of QFE part of windows exe version number to handle leading zero.

* Spin busy spinner in PC application when copying large single files.

* Set plugin params and chunks from VFX chunk files after starting the plugin.
  This is because some plugs (like VB3) will not respond to having their stuff
  set unless they are started.

--------------------------------------
v1.5 20100317
--------------------------------------

* Don't write into the user field of the vst effect structure in plugins. Some plugins
  appear to incorrectly use this field for their own purposes (e.g. NoName EQ).

* Resize gui windows after calling the vst attach function. This makes the editor gui
  the correct size for plugins that only know what size they want *after* the attach
  call (e.g. NoName EQ).

* Mac - show gui's correctly for plugins that formerly showed a mostly black screen.
        (fixes gui problems with any plugin that uses the vst gui library that
        comes with the vst sdk v2.4).

* Support .vfxdll files for running only on a V-MACHINE.
    - If running headless and loading a dll, and if there is a .vfxdll
      alongside the dll with the same basename, then load the .vfxdll instead.
    - When importing a dll, import any identically basenamed .vfxdll.
    - corollary: solves OPX problems for the OPX developer.

* Buffer overrun fixes to plugin notification queues in host.
    - Check for buffer overrun on host callback queues.
    - Dynamically grow host callback queues up to an absolute maximum size.
    - corollary: MiniMonsta and LoungeLizard work fine now (and any
                 other plugins that were running of the ends of the
                 notification queues).

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100227
--------------------------------------

* L/R audio-in controls work properly when there is only one plugin, or
  only one channel of audio in use.

* Windows plugin wizard is more streamlined - encourages looking in dropdowns
  (no more browse buttons).

* Slot letter goes in VST GUI title bar.

* VST gui's size and resize correctly.

* Don't blat custom gui displays with animated messages.

* No gain multiplication is performed on channels with their level
  set to 0dB. So there is now a performance gain when running at 0dB levels.

* Midi note-on is not sent to plugins in a muted channel.

* Cannot have newlines or tabs in preset names when renaming them.

* New PC delay option only applies to midi-program change, and manual program
  change by button press always needs a confirm.

* "Preset and Plugins" PC mode reads "Preset then Plugins".

* MIDI-learned "Accept" and "Back" don't scroll left in normal menu mode.
  "Accept" only ever works for loading a preset when scrolling through
  presets and deleting/importing/exporting. "Back" no longer decreases
  parameter values.

* Click-and-hold only causes key repeats for sensible repeatable operations.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100225
--------------------------------------

Windows and Mac

* Treat second click of a double click as a second single click if the
  double-clicked object does not respond to double clicks.

* Added mixer midi channel gui control.

* Fixed mouse wheel stepping on tempo and time signature gui controls.

All Platforms

* The vfx application ignores bank-select msb and lsb when program changes are
  being routed to plugins.

* When program changes and bank changes are routed to vfx preset and bank
  changes, the program change that is applied by the vfx application is the
  exact program change that was received by the vfx application. The same
  change was made for midi-learned controls for bank and preset changes.

* Bank and program changes received by the vfx application that are routed to
  vfx bank and program changes update the display only, just as if a front
  panel button was pressed, or a midi-learned bank or preset knob was twiddled.

* The ordering of global MIDI learn parameters on the front panel display
  was changed.

* The "accept" button can now be global-MIDI-learned.

* Plugins only receive MIDI program and bank changes if the program/bank
  change comes in on a channel that the plugin is configured to receive on.

* Mixer gets it's own assignable MIDI channel.

* Program change semantics tweaked. The two options are now:
    1. Program change to plugins only.
    2. Program change to Preset and Plugins. If the preset doesn't want
       the program change (i.e. the mixer is set to some channel that
       is different to the channel of the program change), then the
       program change goes to any plugins that want it.

* The VFX application correctly accepts bank MSB and LSB before a program change.

* Front panel and midi-learn options for mute toggles, solo toggles, and a 
  'play this' command which mutes instrument channels that are not the
  channel with the 'play this' command being given to it.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100222
--------------------------------------

All Platforms

* Busy messages get a spinner.
  - On any file/folder copy/delete on PC app.
  - For any busy message on V-MACHINE.
  - Spinner is next to the "please wait", rather than the
    changeable busy text above.

Windows

* parse_input_file wizard command accepts non-absolute paths.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100218
--------------------------------------

Windows and Mac

* Fixed save file and parse input file wizard commands.

* Fixed all problems related to the mouse pointer getting stuck in the top
  left corner of the screen.

* Main app window shows before wizards are loaded and before
  the first library is extracted, and the front panel shows that those two
  things are happening. So there is no more gui-less long wait at startup for
  wizard extraction or bank loading.

All Platforms

* VFX host respondes positively to "receiveVstMidiEvent" and
  "sendVstMidiEvent" "host-cando" calls (so widi plugin should work now).

* Files overwritten by the "vmachine_files_to_create" wizard section are
  restored when running a plugin on a PC that was formerly run on a
  V-MACHINE.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 2010208
--------------------------------------

Windows and Mac

* NIHWID.exe is back in firmware resources!

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100121
--------------------------------------

All Platforms

* Front panel buttons nicely increment and decrement gain and pan
  with correct value snapping and sensible inc/dec amounts.

* Pan-centre is now 128 so that MIDI CC value 64 will set centre-pan.

* Fixed bug where front panel was not showing control values when they reached
  their lowest value.

* Quadratic curve on volume faders for perceived linear change in volume.

* Gain factors are pre-calculated, so there is a cpu speed-up in the host.

* Front panel shows slider gain in dB.

* Plugins only receive MIDI CC's on midi channels that match the configured midi
  channels for the plugins.

* Corrected bad CRC calculation in VFX chunk files. Upped vfx chunk version to
  version 3.

V-MACHINE

* V-Machine performs application administration even when CPU load is high,
  so stuff that should happen still happens (e.g. button presses, synchronise
  with PC, detect connected MIDI controller/storage, etc).

* V-Machine performs application admin interleaved with audio when CPU load
  is high and there has been a front panel button press.

* Buffer size for license tool output increased from 1024 bytes to 10*1024 bytes.

* MIDI is forwarded from USB-connected MIDI controllers to a connected PC.

Windows and Mac

* Latest wizard database at build time (version 20100119).

* Vastly improved slider/knob values from GUI and from MIDI:
   - 0dB, centre pan, min, and max levels in gui only ever appear when the underlying value
     truly is 0dB, centre pan, min, or max respectively.

   - Incoming MIDI CC's learned to the mixer are able to set the maximum level
     on controls (previously they could only set the maximum minus 1).

* Vastly improved control slider/knob dragging:
   - mouse doesn't leave window and irritatingly run out of room
   - knob doesn't accept dragging outside the range of the knob's values,
     so you can slide down to the minimum, then down some more, then
     immediately slide up to increase the value.
   - double click to go to snap value (currently 0dB or centre pan)

* Much nicer main window dragging - the application no longer errantly performs 
  gui processing while the main window is being dragged.

Windows

* Resizable and multi-line input prompt dialog.

* More roomy and more nicely spaced vfx message/question box.

* Fixed stupid bug where mouse wheel events were affecting mouse move coordinates.

* Disallow right-click while dragging controls.

Mac

* Main window drags correctly and doesn't lose track of where the mouse is.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100111
--------------------------------------

All Platforms

* Allow buffer sizes as low as 32 samples on V-MACHINE.
* AAS tools in VFX firmware resources.
* Accelerating click-and-hold on front panel buttons.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20100107
--------------------------------------

All Platforms

* Fixed subtle intermittent bug in free space checks on linux and mac.
Mac Application

Mac and PC

* Allow opening old ".vfxvmachine" files with rename to ".vfxlibrary".

* Tweaked menu structure a bit, so V-MACHINE is back at the top level,
  and removed duplicate items from main menu.

* Bank and preset context-sensitive menus are now different to main
  menu bank/preset submenus. The context-sensitive ones contain
  import/export items. Import/export is all under "File" in the main
  menu.

Mac

* Caught up on new functionality of PC app. The most noticeable parts are new
  dialogs and USB-hotplug support.

* Restructured and simplified mac menus/hotkeys.

* Main window background is drawn when deminiaturizing.

* Mac app data folder has moved from ~/.vfx to
  ~/Library/Preferences/com.smproaudio.vfx_application.data

* All app options live in the .vfxoptions file. Mac-style plist
  prefs to be used only when not affecting shared code handling
  of options.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091210
--------------------------------------

PC Application

* Embedded latest wizard database (20091210) in PC application.

* Renaming a bank that doesn't yet exist on disk works now
  - an empty bank folder is created with the new name.

All Platforms

* More lenient bank load code that prevented stupid bank load
  failure when zero banks should have been loaded without any
  error.

* Fixed nasty bug in parent directory getter code inside disk
  space checker function that broke anything getting disk space
  on non-existant directories inside non-existent directories.

V-MACHINE

* Export with plugins to empty stick and to empty library on
  v-machine works now.

* Export from empty internal drive to stick works now.

* Disconnect vmachine after firmware update on PC side - ensures a
  disconnect occurs if update fails.

* Disconnect vmachine before throwing up "firmware-update-necessary" message boxes.
    corollary: Message box for actual update appears once the prompt dialog is closed, 
    if the v-machine is restarted in update mode in the meantime without the prompt
    dialog being closed.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091208
--------------------------------------

* Application detects change in MIDI devices if MIDI devices are changed
  in options dialog.

* Always enable potential V-MACHINE's if the MIDI device count has changed
  since MIDI-enable options were last saved.

* Don't save MIDI options if no changes are made to MIDI options in options
  dialog.

* Determine potential V-MACHINE's by manufacturer and product id, rather than
  by device name (which is different in different language environments).

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091203
--------------------------------------

* Top active library is labelled "Primary".

* Importing a plugin with a license sequence now lets the user know 
  there is a license sequence even when no V-MACHINE is connected.

* Compiled 20091202 wizard database into the executable.

* Fixed bug in audio device re-configuration code that was causing crashes/hangs.

* Removed forced closure on audio device change (which was inadequately implemented
  anyway (i.e. still invoked audio code and caused crashes), so audio devices can be
  changed on the fly now.

* More helpful messages about firmware updates.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091202
--------------------------------------

* Standard installer icon.

* The first build to use the stabalised and reproducable build environment.

* Implemented MIDI device selection GUI in options dialog.
  - All devices except potential V-MACHINEs are disabled by default.

* Increased MIDI buffer size inside VST host to handle larger/faster amounts of
  MIDI from plugins that emit MIDI. Certain plugins can generate a fair bit all
  at once, especially when manipulating controls on the plugin's GUI editor.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091126
--------------------------------------

* Reworked MIDI-routing so that it works.
  - Fixed bug where plugs that emitted MIDI fed back on themselves.
  - MIDI-IN for any slot user-selectably comes from the computer,
    the previous plugin in the chain, or both, or neither.
  - Any slot has a selectable MIDI-THRU, that passes MIDI coming
    into that slot into the output from that slot.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091123
--------------------------------------

* New $VFX_BUILTIN()s:
    $VFX_BUILTIN(common_program_files)
    $VFX_BUILTIN(win_common_program_files)
    $VFX_BUILTIN(destination_dll_dir)

* DLL's can get their directory before their ID has been established.
  (so plugins that do this such as "Oddity" can be imported).

* Installer has checkboxes to view FAQ and launch VFX application.

* About box shows all text and has nicer looking size.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091119
--------------------------------------

* Nice bugfix to nasty subtle windows bug in GetOpenFileName()
  and GetSaveFileName() functions. Those functions change the
  current directory and lock it, hence if the user browses 
  to a USB stick for example, the USB stick cannot be safely removed.
  So now USB device removal notifications work properly in the
  VFX app on Windows.

* Bugfixes to low-level copy code.

* Reworked code for discovery of real location of windows folders on unix
  filesystem when running inside wine. Folders don't have to exist now in
  order to get what the path to them would be.
  So wizard symlinks and file copies to windows drives should really work now.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091118
--------------------------------------

* Save and load vst bank chunks instead of vst preset chunks. Some plugins
  such as Albino only support bank chunks, so this makes a whole category
  of plugins (i.e. bank-chunk-only plugins) work. A possible downside is
  longer load times, but I guess we wait and see if this is really a problem
  in practice - probably only for plugins which have a lot of internal patches
  and the end user doesn't realise this and always saves them all.

* Use dynamic buffers for low-level line scanning and wizard array scanning.
  Corollary: wizard files with long wizard arrays now work.

* assert() all reg file bytes are written to temp reg file for reg
  section in wizard files.

* Look for nice-ified wizard folder names. i.e. plugs with bad filesystem
  characters in the plugin name will work with the wizard system now.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091113
--------------------------------------

* Added registry hack for original shipped and pre-loaded sampletank that
  did not have any registry information in it's wizard file.

* Fixed bug where win-style path checker function was not checking
  properly. Corollary: stuff like win-style paths in symlink section
  of wizard files works now.

* Added front panel menu to set playback gain.

* Gain settings on front panel go in steps of 1dB (instead of 0.1dB which
  is what was there before).

* Limit gain settings range on front panel to what the underlying sound driver
  supports.

* Fixed bug where leaving out the optional input prompt default value
  in a wizard file crashed the VFX application.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091112
--------------------------------------

* Fixed bug where VFX app would not run on vista without admin rights.
  Fix was very odd - basically ignore failed return code from device
  notification request, and the notification works anyway .. strange.
  Testing this fix requires testing that usb device removal/insertion
  works correctly and the active/fallback libraries change appropriately.

* Fixed bug where a strange uncloseable window appeared when deleting
  a plugin while its editor window was open.

* Fixed bug where "import: all banks + plugins" was not importing
  everything when there were multiple libraries to import from, and
  there was more than one bank with the same name to import.

* Fixed bug where more than four plugin search paths crashed
  the VFX app. (e.g. when more than three libraries are on
  a stick plugged into a V-MACHINE). There can now be up
  to 64 plugin search paths.

* Fixed bug where program changes could crash the V-MACHINE when
  it was in "program change changes preset" mode.

* Don't crash and burn when wizard symlink args are bad.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091111
--------------------------------------

* added wizard builtins for user's local app data folder:
    $VFX_BUILTIN(user_local_application_data)
    $VFX_BUILTIN(win_user_local_application_data)

* "input_prompt" wizard sequence command can take an optional
  third argument that specifies the initial value for the 
  prompt.

* $VFX_REG_STRING() takes a third argument which is the default
  value if the string does not exist in the registry.

* Put in sampletank assimilation hack so that the old shipped
  sampletank library (as installed on units at the factory)
  will work with the new firmware. The sampletank prefs file
  will be changed to reference P: instead of Z: if a Z:
  reference exists. So the old sampletank works on new software
  on all platforms now. It's still an ugly hack though.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091110
--------------------------------------

* App icon top left. Minimize and close buttons at right of menu buttons.

* Added wizard support for more builtins:
   - $VFX_BUILTIN(application_data)
   - $VFX_BUILTIN(win_application_data)
   - $VFX_BUILTIN(user_application_data)
   - $VFX_BUILTIN(win_user_application_data)

* Fixed plugin assimilation bug where the plugin name part of the "dll_name"
  wizard datum was not being converted into something acceptable by the file
  system. Now all invalid file characters in "dll_name" are replaced with
  an underscore.

* Fixed wizard file bug where absolute paths were not working
  correctly in the "symlinks" section.

* Wizard database is embedded in application exe.
  When the vfx application is run, if the embedded database is
  more up to date than the one on disk, then the embedded database
  will magically appear and be used.

* Hint on how to update firmware in message that tells you
  when firmware is old.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091104
--------------------------------------

* "execute_tool" works again.

* Fixed bug where first argument of lines in "dirs_to_copy" and "files_to_copy"
  wizard sections were not being correctly checked if they contained a ":".
  e.g. "X:/foo/bar"

* Fixed long-standing bug in directory tree copy that was not
  correctly ensuring the destination's parent existed, only it's
  grandparent.

* Wizard does not screw up it's parse buffer when doing slash expansions
  (forward slash, backslash, etc).

* Fixed bug where parameters to wizard expansions were not being
  parsed correctly. (Corolloray: "store" sequence command works now,
  amongst other things).

* Allow parameters to be set to values less than 0.0 and greater than 1.0.
  This is needed because some plugins use these out of range values in
  a happy flaunting of the VST standard.

* Don't die if a plugin changes it's parameter count on the fly.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091101
--------------------------------------

* Fixed wizard bug where nested functions were not being expanded
  correctly.

  e.g. The following snippet now works fine:

        $VFX_BACK_SLASHES($VFX_BUILTIN(program_files))

* No newline needed at the end of a wizard file.

* Any wizard array item can be commented out with a "#".

* Fixed bug where "dirs_to_copy" and "files_to_copy" wizard sections
  were not handling lines beginning with windows-style absolute paths
  correctly.

* Wizard "dirs_to_copy" and "files_to_copy" sections can have absolute
  windows-style paths at the start of each copy line (but with forward
  slashes) that will result in a copy from the correct folder in wine
  for that drive on non-windows platforms.

  e.g. The following will work fine on Mac:

    dirs_to_copy:
    ...
    C:/foo/bar.txt
    ...


* Wizard "dirs_to_copy" section can have include and exclude patterns
  after path specifications separated by semicolons.
  e.g.

    dirs_to_copy:
    ...
    foo:bar;include:*.foo;exclude:fred
    foo:bar;exclude: foo*.txt
    foo:bar;exclude: */Organ
    ...
    
  If the keyword is left out, then an "include" operation is assumed.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: the match is performed on the full source path, and
                  not just the filename. An initial '*/' is implied
                  if it is not explicitly written in, so "exclude: Organ"
                  will match against only the final path component.

* Can import VFX-ified plugins via the "Import VST Plugin"
  menu/dialog. A plugin that has wizard info alongside is
  considered to be a VFX plugin, and when imported its files
  are just copied verbatim.

  The import plugin dialog widgets indicate when a VFX plugin
  is being imported, and there is text saying a direct folder
  copy will take place.

* Juggled menus around:
   - plugin right-click has license, and vfx auth
   - plugin chooser menu has an "install plugin" subitem
   - there is a plugin menu in the main right-click menu
     with install, license and vfx auth
   - V-MACHINE menu with infrequent subitems lives inside
     file menu
   - There is a main menu "sync..." item.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091028
--------------------------------------

* Added wizard sequence command "store" which looks like this:

    store;<wizard_variable>;<value>

  The above line sets the value of a wizard variable to the literal
  string that the given value expands to. This literal string is
  saved to the wizard file.

  This is useful if you want to capture information from a PC at
  the time of import and/or licensing of a plugin (e.g. The
  path to the special program files folder on a German install
  of Windows).

* Added wizard section called "import_sequence" that contains the
  same things that the license sequence can contain but is run 
  as the first stage of importing a plugin.

* Added new builtins for getting windows-style paths.
  (e.g. "C:\Program Files" instead of "/foo/.wine/c_drive/Program Files")
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(win_program_files)
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(win_user_documents)

* Refactored wizard functionality for plugin file copy, directory copy, and
  symlink creation so that absolute absolute paths can be used. The useful
  result of this is that path expansions such as $VFX_BUILTIN(program_files) will
  work in these sections.

* Much nicer missing file/folder prompt when copying plugin files and folders.

* Removed double prompt to license plugin after importing.

* Greater leniency for allowed filename characters (bugzilla #2201).

* Better error reporting for license sequence.

* Fixed bug where plugin files were not updated with licensing information.
  i.e. Licensing a plugin should work properly now!!

* License steps can be commented out with "#" at the beginning of the line
  in the wizard file.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091027
--------------------------------------

* Prevented self-referential infinite lookup in wizard file.

* Reworked wizard file parser to support new primitives.

* Removed "variable_values" section from wizard files. Now any
  wizard lookup string can be a variable value.

* Wizard files now support:
    - $VFX_EXPAND(<user_variable>)
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(user_name)
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(program_files)
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(user_documents)
    - $VFX_BUILTIN(dll_dir)
    - $VFX_REG_STRING(<key>,<value_name>)
    - $VFX_CLOSE_BRACKET()
    - $VFX_FORWARD_SLASHES(<string>)
    - $VFX_BACK_SLASHES(<string>)
    - $VFX_DOUBLE_BACK_SLASHES(<string>)

* Plugin ID can be on any line in wizard file.

* Removed "Importing Plugin..." LCD message glitch.

* Fixed introduced bug where PANIC was not handled by the VFX
  application while a custom-GUI VFX plugin was running.
  i.e. You can "PANIC" to leave a VFX plugin GUI on the V-MACHINE again now.

* Re-enabled high thread priority for VFX application on V-MACHINE and MAc.
  Turns out this makes most plugins take less CPU.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091023
--------------------------------------

* Refactored licensing and v-machine-app-running code to be more manageable,
  readable, and expandable. Fixed a lot of bugs in the process, and there are
  no more state loops calling several functions for single units of
  functionality.

* Fixed bug where wizard array items could not contain "..."

* V-MACHINE wine reserves 1GB of address space for windows apps
  (as opposed to the 512MB patch that was in there previously).
  Mac wine is still at 512MB - maybe that should change too sometime?

* Fixed major memory bugs in code that scanned strings from files for the
  licensing sequence.

* Wizard file syntax changes/enhancements:
    - All variable expansions appear as $VFX_EXPAND(FOO)

    - There is a new "variable_values" section that is used to expand 
      variables. Variable expansion is no longer permanent. i.e.
      You can re-use wizard files that live next to plugins.

    - Variable values can reference other variables.

* Made growable buffer macros for use where growable buffers are needed.
  (Loading chunkfiles, wizard files, etc).


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091013
-------------------------------------

* Import plugin works again (but not license sequence).

* Scroll bars on combo boxes in vst import dialog.

* recursively find VST plugins for dropdown in import dialog.

* wizard magic folder is created if it doesn't already exist when checking
  the internet for the latest wizard file.

* Fixed bug where non-chunk-saving plugins caused a crash when saving them.

* V-MACHINE firmware runs again.

* Fixed introduced bug that caused crashes when exporting to a library
  directly below a drive letter. e.g. "X:\foo.vfxlibrary".

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20091009
-------------------------------------

* Import plugin code is broken in this build. You can use the new
  import dialog, but clicking "import" will never result in anything being
  imported.

* Made new "import vst plugin" dialog that scans for plugins and wizard files,
  and can download wizard updates from the web.

   - Intelligently checks plugins as they are selected on the fly.
   - Only downloads new database if there is a new database. Does
     the check by downloading a database info file first.
   - Displays info on selected plugin and wizard file.

* Implemented wizard database mechanism whereby a zipfile is downloaded
  and extracted into the magic folder.

* Reworked wizard info engine as follows:

 - There is no more statically compiled wizard information. This is just
   annoying and becomes outdated very quickly.

 - Wizard information only comes from wizard files. There is at most one loaded
   wizard file at any time (c.f. old system of all wizard info loaded all the
   time).  Most of the time when the VFX app is running there will be no loaded
   wizard file.

 - Wizard information is only ever read and used in these situations:
      * when a plugin is imported when a plugin is assimilated into the host
      * during plugin-search (normally at application startup).

 - The VFX application's total inherent wizard knowledge is made up of the
   wizard files in the wizard magic folder that lives in the application data
   area.

 - There is no magic area on the V-MACHINE itself. The magic folder is for the
   desktop application only.

 - If a plugin DLL has a wizard file next to it then that wizard file is used.

 - If a plugin has no wizard file alongside, then no wizard info is used.


* PC app gets system menu.

* Corrected hacky string clipping of drawn strings on Windows platform.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090928
-------------------------------------

* The desktop application will not talk to a V-MACHINE that does not have
  the same version of software as the desktop application.

* Fixed long-standing bug where changing to program 0 was not possible.

* "Program change changes preset" works again.

* Can minimize the PC application by clicking the taskbar button.

* The VFX VST host will no longer set parameters that report themselves as non-automatable.

* Fixed long-standing bug where a binary or integer parameter was not 
  being identified as such, and was overwriting the
  VFX_VST_HOST_PARAMETER_INFO flag.

* Plugin names use all available space plugin label area on main screen.

* Import/export menu items on bank and preset menus.

* Quotes around name of changed active library in front panel popup.

* Removed front panel popup message log entry.

* Fixed bug where synchronised plugins were not being placed
  in their own folder inside "/storage/plugs", but rather in 
  their own folder.

* Altered "PANIC" mode, so that plugins without wizard files
  will not be recognised (and hence no plugin DLL's are loaded
  at startup).

* Reverted change from last build that made plugin paths all
  be inside /plugs - it wasn't helpful, and made it hard to
  work out which plugins were external.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090925
-------------------------------------

* Plugins that run off external sticks have their path set to,
  and are LoadLibrary()ed from, their symlink inside /plugs.

* vfx_symlink() always tries to delete old target link before making new one.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090923
-------------------------------------

* Fixed read/write bugs in new chunk file load/save code.

* Fixed file read/write bug on Windows where files > 4096 bytes in
  size would fail their reads and writes.

* Removed assertion failure in PC app that was occuring when a
  Windows device changed before the gui module was initialised.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090922
-------------------------------------

* Removed calls to change vfx application's thread priority inside
  the host when doing various things with plugins. These calls did
  not seem to server any purpose.

* Comprehensive rework of plugin chunk save/load:
   - chunk files of up to 10MB in size are permitted.
   - chunk files will not be saved for plugins that do not
     support chunk files AND have no parameters.
   - Loading a chunk file into a plugin follows the VST guidelines
     now and calls effBeginLoadProgram, effBeginSetProgram, and
     effEndSetProgram.
   - Chunk files now contain metadata about the chunk including:
       plugin ID, data size, checksum, parameter count. 
   - A chunk file will not be applied to a plugin if:
       (- the checksum on the chunk file is bad)
       OR
       (- the plugin ID does not match
          OR the parameter count does not match
          OR the plugin version does not match)
       OR
       (- effBeginLoadProgram is implemented by the plugin
          and refuses to accept the chunk)
   - Previously bad chunks were applied and weird crashes
     and behaviour happened.
   - Obviously chunk files currently in circulation have no
     metadata and they will still fail when applied to the
     wrong plugin.

* Select plugin menu has plugins sorted by name and FX plugins have (fx)
  in brackets at the end of their name.

* PC shows same display and spinner as V-MACHINE when synchronising.

* Clean restarts on V-MACHINE front panel - so you don't see strange
  old text.

* Import/export/sync dialogs:
    - "All Banks" instead of "Banks" at the top node.
    - New helpful notes line says more about what is going on.

* Front panel config options to the left, and preset management to
  the right (reverse of what was there before).

* Report wine version in log when going to info menu.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090916
-------------------------------------

* Safer code for getting parameter value strings.

* Diagnostics in h8 send code.

* More robust front_panel_device_write() that more explicitly handles the
  long-string case, assert()s for valid row, and will not send
  unprintable characters up the lpc.

* Assert that parameters are set to something between 0.0 and 1.0
  inclusive inside the VFX VST host.
  
* Assert that a parameter being set is within the range of valid parameters
  for a plugin in the VFX VST host.

* Delete plugins menu updates when deleting plugins and in other
  circumstances where it used to buggily not update.

* PANIC works on PC.

* PANIC shows "PANIC!" as a front panel popup.

* Changed front panel popup time to 2 seconds.

* Fixed bug where front panel popups were being killed by
  other front panel writes.

* Active library change enhancements:
    - "Fallback" library option.
    - currently used library is shown in options dialog
    - name of changed library is notified in a front panel popup

* Entries in "delete plugin" menu are sorted alphabetically.

* Fixed bug where "delete plugin" menu was not refreshed when changing
  active library.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090914
-------------------------------------

* Delete menu only allows deleting internal banks and presets.

* Fixed: Confirm and Return still exsist when changing banks and presets.
  Change to 'load' and 'back' to be consistant. Same for plugin parade.

* Fixed: 'cant find DLL' messages should be changed to 'cant find plugin' or a
  similar message.

* Fixed: The verb and back are cut short on the vmachine screen by the space
  used by level meters. The moment you enter the menu and back is shown so easy
  to reproduce.

* Fixed: FUT825 when using the virtual lcd in pc app to perform a export
  bank+plugins by pressing the virtual menu button. Seems all the export
  functions in there create an error.

* Fixed: import from the virtual lcd screen and menu in the pc app, does not do
  anything and does not create an error.

* Fixed: Mem 0% does not show the amount of ram used in the system info menu page.

* Fixed: snw2425 error when trying to export bank in firmware with no usb drive
  connected.

* Fixed bug where input gain was broken in audio menu on V-MACHINE.

* 0dB channel 0 and master faders for new presets - 
  so you can try stuff out quickly without pulling faders around.

* 0db channel 0 and master faders for the plugin parade.

* Turned on audio capture for asio devices.

* Explicity "not saved" notification when trying to save from
  plugin parade.

* Cannot delete external plugins and banks from front panel menu.

    - preset names have "fx:" prefix.
    - audio capture is turned on.

   - sorted alphabetically
   - "[]" around externally loaded plugins

* Front panel menu re-ordered to put exciting frequent operations
  less button presses away. First menu item is always version.


--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090910
-------------------------------------

* Unload all plugins on PC app exit.

* USB hot-plug implemented, so the active library can happily
  live on a stick, and you can plug in and out without restarting the app.

* User-configured active library remains configured until they
  change it. Active library temporarily reverts to default
  when user-configured library is unavailable.

* Fixed bug where a new library name could not be OK'd in the
  change active library file prompt.

* Tidied up front panel display - verb/back/ok/cancel.
* Tidied up import/export/sync strings - more uniform and informative.

* Set focus to active library widget in options dialog when
  user cancels the open-file dialog.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090908
-------------------------------------

* Enforce all internal paths to not have two slashes in a row.
  i.e. "/foo//bar" is invalid.

* Added user option to set active library path.
   - If the path does not reside on an extant volume at application
   - startup, then the default active library path is used.
   - The active library can be changed without a restart of the application.

* Any active library is renamed to have the ".vfxlibrary" extension
  if possible (i.e. if not read-only).

* Default active library is inside the user's music folder and is
  named "V-MACHINE Library.vfxlibrary".

* Wizard magic folder lives inside the app. data folder, and not
  inside the active library folder.

* V-MACHINE state file lives inside the app. data folder, and not
  inside the active library folder.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090903
-------------------------------------

* Fixed the bug that prevented the VFX VST host API from ever being enabled.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090902
-------------------------------------

* Fixed bad comms over USB with 64 bit int's in serialised structs
  (so vmachine reports direct disk space over usb now).
* Fixed hang on delete banks with name.
* Fixed hang on "clear v-machine".
* "Delete Plugin" front panel menu fixes:
    - shows all internal plugins only (irrespective of which
      internal and external plugins are actually being used by the host).
    - menu is always visible and indicates when there are no plugins
      to delete
    - no more "delete plugin" crashes.
    - menu is available in PC application
* Fixed buffer size bug that was mangling bank names for bank
  folders of length similiar to the size of the bank name buffer.

--------------------------------------
v1.1 20090830
--------------------------------------

* Don't show "no banks" bank if there are no internal banks but there
  are external banks.
* External plugins take priority over internal plugins on v-machine
* New "Enable/disable VFX VST Host API commands". So the API is dead unless
  the "enable" command is called.
  - corollory: plugins that call the VFX api without checking the host type
               now work.
* Plugin name abbreviations work better and worked out safer.
* Lots of new plugin management code:
    - folders can be scanned on the fly for plugins
    - the host can rescan its set of plugins without needing a restart
* Massive import/export rework:
    - new import/export gui with tree views
    - nice folder prompts on windows - behaviour similar to mac packages
    - host can change sets of plugins on the fly
    - can import/export with/without plugins
    - can import/export with/without replacing plugins
    - folder size checks that abandon early if check fails early
    - removed lots of bugs
    - more durable against folders with duplicate banks/plugs
* Sync rework to match new import/export:
    - new gui tree
    - prompt to export to stick if sync will take too long
    - folder size checks that abandon early if check fails early
    - can sync with/without plugins
    - can sync with/without replacing plugins
* Reworked V-MACHINE import/export from stick logic:
    - always overwrite plugins
    - proper checks for which plugins reside where
    - immediate availability of exported banks
* Folder size checks work heaps better and abandon early if the 
    check fails early.
* Try and make files and directories writeable before copying over or deleting them.
    - Can be good when copying off CD on windows, because target files in those
      cases by default remain read-only on windows.
* Many bugfixes.

--------------------------------------
